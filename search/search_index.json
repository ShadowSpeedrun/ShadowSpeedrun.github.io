The only files provided on GitHub are the configuration files needed to apply the settings and changes to run Shadow SX. What is Shadow SX Shadow SX is a ROM hack of the ENG NTSC version of Shadow the Hedgehog that aims to provide quality of life changes for improving the speedrunning experience without any major changes to the core gameplay experience. Shadow SX is playable on GameCubes, on Wiis with Homebrew, or on computers using Dolpin Emulator. Although this website started as a means of consolidating and proving data for the console releases. Everything you see on this site should apply to both the console versions and Shadow SX. Due to changes to the game code, Shadow SX will be considered it's own thing seperate from the original console releases. Seperate Leaderboards for any of the categories or levels will be provided at a future time. Changes Compared to the Original In Game Timer (IGT) Quality of Life changes Checkpoints no longer pause the IGT The game will no longer pause the timer while in the checkpoint menu. This prevents the use of the checkpoint for saving IGT while waiting for another in game event to play out. More important though, is that this change allows the use of IGT timing for runs that utilize the Chaos Control Glitch. Deaths no longer reset the IGT to the last checkpoint time One of the biggest headaches when timing IGT runs on console was having to manually calculate the time from deaths to checkpoints. With this change, the time continues without interruptions after death. The time you end the level with is the final time now. Restarting a stage during a \"Story Mode\" playthrough no longer resets the IGT This change, while applies to every level, is mainly targeted to the shorter Boss Fights where one might reset quickly early on if a setup doesnt go to plan. Like with the Death fix above, the timer will simply continue form that point on until the end of the level or boss fight. This does NOT apply to levels or bosses that are started with \"Select Mode\" as this would quickly become annoying for Individual Level (IL) runs and attempts. This applies only for Normal Story, Last Story, and Expert Mode playthroughs. Preventing timer slow down during boss fight Chaos Control A neat mechanic for boss fights was slowing down time when using Chaos Control instead of speeding through the level, which makes sense considering that boss arenas are small enclosed areas. When time slows down, the IGT slows down considerably. Since SX changes the IGT to be more of a RTA without loads timer, the IGT will now longer slow down. Everything else should remain unaffected. IL Quality of Life changes The following changes were made to not only improve the quality of life for IL attempts, but also to keep Story and IL runs more in sync. Partners no longer have intro cutscenes When you first encounter a partner character, there's a quick intro that plays to introduce them. This gets annoying after many attempts so the intros have been turned off. This also allows the player to focused more on movement for the sections they would normally be stopped in, just like if they were doing multiple IL attempts. Infinite Lives for Select Mode Kinda self explanatory, no longer needing to worry about lives makes IL a lot more bearable. This only applies to the Select Mode. The Story Style game modes work the same as the original. To account for the handicap that is available in the Egg Dealer fights, holding D-Pad Up while selecting one of the Egg Dealer levels will enable a mode where you will start with infinite 0 lives. Secret Doors Open Faster. If you have all 5 keys for a level, the Secret Door will now automatically open, just like it would if you had opened it normally, and reentered the area after a death. This was how one could speed up IL in the original game. Now it's available to everyone without needing to interact with it first. This also allows for Story Mode and ILs to use similar strategies. Expert Mode from Select Mode Holding D-Pad Up while entering a level will place you in the Expert Mode Variant of the level for easier access and practice of those level layouts. Emulator Changes The following changes were made to the default Dolphin configuration to improve game performance. Recommended Settings Included in the download is a set of recommended settings that have been tested to provide a good gameplay experience. If that is not the case for you, reach out to let us know. Overclocking with Dolphin Settings Since Shadow SX and the console Shadow releases will not be comparable, Shadow SX will utilize the Dolphin Emulator's ability to run at a higher clock frequency for better performance and a smoother experience. This should play similar to running on Nintendont on a Nintendo Wii. Improved Loading Times The Dolphin Emulator has a setting to allow faster reading of the ROM data. So instead of having to match a similar rate to the GameCube disc drive, the emulator can read and load data much faster allowing vastly shorter load times. Normally getting from the end of Westopolis to the beginning of Glyphic Canyon takes a little over a minute on Wii. With this change, it now takes 48 seconds. Reduced Bloom When playing on Dolphin, the bloom effect is a bit stronger than what is visible on console. A change was made to reduce this back to expected levels. Optional Changes These changes are optional settings: Race Timer Along with re-managing the IGT time, I have been able to set aside some space to keep track of the current total time for a Story or Expert Mode runs. Currently this is a option that will swap out the IGT timer spot when enabled. Options for Skipping Cutscenes New file runs will now be able to skip cutscenes without needing to view the cutscene first like in the original. There is an option to disable this change if you wanted to run a New Game run like you would on the original, notably for runs like All Endings and 100% No Library where cutscenes have an effect on the run. Glossy Effect on Characters The glossy effect on characters can be left alone, reduced, or removed. Replace Button Images for UI Different Textures are available that allow swapping out the default GameCube buttons with PlayStation or Xbox images. Modern Controls for UI When using GameCube controls, no changes are needed. But if you are using a PlayStation or Xbox style controller, turning this option on will allow you to control the game just as you would on the Xbox or PS2 versions of the game. Custom Shadow Colors Use the color adjuster tool in the Shadow SX Launcher to customize the color of Shadow for a more personalized experience.","title":"Shadow SX"},{"location":"ShadowSX/#download-on-github","text":"","title":"Download on GitHub"},{"location":"ShadowSX/#click-here-to-visit-the-github-release-page","text":"You will need to provide your own clean rip of the Shadow ENG NTSC ROM to run with the emulator.

However, during some other states the head may not track while the boss is vulnerable. However, no other chaos spear states exist in between. It turns out every ms spent charging adds to this amount - yes, even holding for 0.01 seconds produces a result of 6.311096 damage. It is not necessary to have the effect change color. The chaos spear charging blue/yellow particle effect (before the blue circle) will do 15 damage and takes ~1.5s to reach this state - which is half the time of a full spear for only 5dmg less. Unfortunately, to achieve an optimal time of <=0:50 (collecting no rings) requires 10 fully charged 20 damage hits, and due to the boss invulnerability period the window to achieve this time is extremely precise. A time of 0:49.82 has been proven possible via TAS: Player Spawn Location Due to an oversight in the Super Shadow Fly state, the player's position is not reset when you perform a restart. You can utilize this to change your starting position. Phase 2 Differences (Half Health) The angle which triggers Wing Guard is wider, requiring the player to have a smaller angle of attack to the eye. Boss States Body Change Occurs when the Player does any damage to the eye. The eye switches which head it lands in. Takes (TODO: VERIFY time per change) 5 seconds per change. Completely invulnerable during this state. Chaos Control Occurs if Shadow is too close, too far away, or the boss was attacked without an active target/lock on to Shadow. Devil Doom has two positions it can be in at any given time. These two points are alternated between each Chaos Control. The exception is at stage init / stage restart, the boss will be in the center, between these two points. The boss will never return to this point once it warps without restarting the stage. Devil Doom will warp to the opposite point when activated. Wing Guard Occurs if an attack is performed from an angle too far left/right of the eye. If Devil Doom's left/right wing are not destroyed, the wing will block the attack. This state can be exploited to extend other state durations. Black Stone Devil Doom will perform the standard fly/idle animation. Stones will spawn out of the ball attached to Devil Doom. Fully vulnerable while in this state, and easy to hit. These stones have various formations that can be created (scattered, circle, line). The stones will shoot lasers at Shadow's current position. Fire Devil Doom will quickly charge a flame breath attack and spew fire in a straight line at Shadow's current position. Invulnerable while the animation is active. Psycho Attack Devil Doom will raise debris (which when destroyed, give Dark points) and Item Balloons (which when destroyed, give 20 Rings). During which his arms are raised upward. His eye is vulnerable during this, however due to the animation and targetting system it will not be possible to hit his eye until his hands reach the peak height. Guaranteed to follow up with Psycho Throw attack. Psycho Throw Can only occur if debris from Psycho Attack are still present. Devil Doom will perform a throw animation. This animation can be either left or right arm instances, depending on where Shadow is located. One of the pieces of debris will be flung directly targeting Shadow's current position. Upon the player getting close to the boss, all the remaining objects will perform a cross section to reach the opposite point of their current positions.

From there, there are 326 different ways of completing the story mode to get to one of the 10 main endings. To make things really simple, we grouped up all of these routes into 5 main category endings to match the 5 final levels in the story mode: Pure Dark, Dark, Neutral, Hero, and Pure Hero. The end condition of each of these categories is to get to the final stage and complete one of its missions and its final boss to reach the credits. Grouping the categories this way instead of 10 categories each with its own boss ending prevents needing to so the same run twice just to do a different end mission and boss where everything else in the run is the same. Some other more targeted categories may decide to run a particular route, like Only Dark Missions and Only Hero Missions, and some may just be based on an arbitrary goal like completing the game with only the Samurai Blade or choosing stages that have the Team Chaotic members. Expert Mode, unlike Story Mode, is a standalone game mode with only 1 possible playthrough, so it's pretty straightforward how that starts and ends. Most categories are also \"New Game+\", as in they allow anything you have already unlocked in previous playthroughs like Secret Keys and Special Weapons. But most importantly, whether or not you have viewed a cutscene as they must be watched in full the first time you see them. The two categories that do not run as \"New Game+\" are All Endings and 100% No Library, which start with a new file and route out playing certain stages to get keys and unlock weapons for later on in the run. For all categories, timing begins on the first input the begins the playthrough and ends at the first frame of the final bosses dying cutscene. Sub Categories This game has a handful of glitches and tricks that can drastically change how the game is played. Some of these tricks are hard or even very difficult to pull off, so there are several rulesets in place that allow playing the game with the tricks you want to use. Any% Use anything the game can do on original hardware / controllers. No Warps The use of Wall Run Warps is not allowed in this category, but everything else is fair game. No CCG This category was the alternative to No Warps where the main glitch at the time was CCG. Glitchless This category is aimed at those who want to run the game as close as we can determine was \"Developer Intended\". No SPW (Special Weapons) Limit the use of weapons to only those that are not exclusive to the Shadow Box that contains weapons that are unlocked after completing Story Mode runs. This ruleset can be mixed and matched depending on what exactly you want to run. i.e.: \"No CCG Yes Warps\". Below is a table of the main game glitches and where they are allowed.

Some other more targeted categories may decide to run a particular route, like Only Dark Missions and Only Hero Missions, and some may just be based on an arbitrary goal like completing the game with only the Samurai Blade or choosing stages that have the Team Chaotic members. Expert Mode, unlike Story Mode, is a standalone game mode with only 1 possible playthrough, so it's pretty straightforward how that starts and ends. Most categories are also \"New Game+\", as in they allow anything you have already unlocked in previous playthroughs like Secret Keys and Special Weapons. But most importantly, whether or not you have viewed a cutscene as they must be watched in full the first time you see them. The two categories that do not run as \"New Game+\" are All Endings and 100% No Library, which start with a new file and route out playing certain stages to get keys and unlock weapons for later on in the run. For all categories, timing begins on the first input the begins the playthrough and ends at the first frame of the final bosses dying cutscene.","title":"How Categories are Determined"},{"location":"GettingStarted/Categories/#sub-categories","text":"This game has a handful of glitches and tricks that can drastically change how the game is played. Some of these tricks are hard or even very difficult to pull off, so there are several rulesets in place that allow playing the game with the tricks you want to use. Any% Use anything the game can do on original hardware / controllers. No Warps The use of Wall Run Warps is not allowed in this category, but everything else is fair game. No CCG This category was the alternative to No Warps where the main glitch at the time was CCG. Glitchless This category is aimed at those who want to run the game as close as we can determine was \"Developer Intended\". No SPW (Special Weapons) Limit the use of weapons to only those that are not exclusive to the Shadow Box that contains weapons that are unlocked after completing Story Mode runs. This ruleset can be mixed and matched depending on what exactly you want to run. i.e.: \"No CCG Yes Warps\". Below is a table of the main game glitches and where they are allowed.

This is to skip the \"Hmph, perfect\" line that plays when getting an A rank. Note that even if you get a rank below an A, the waiting time without pressing Start is the same. Chaos Control Glitch (CCG) In the older builds of the game, there as a bug in the code that allowed an action to be performed after pressing the button to enter the Checkpoint Menu. One of those actions happens to be acting a Chaos Power Dark or Hero. For Dark it's not that useful, but for Hero it is VERY useful. While the checkpoint menu is up, the game timers are frozen as being in a checkpoint menu is essentially a soft pausing of the game. Because of this, once the power of Chaos Control starts while in a checkpoint menu, the player will begin to move in the world, and the timer / chaos power meter remain frozen, allowing for infinite Chaos Control. This is pretty broken for some stages, but others have points that prevent Chaos Control from continuing, and will also stop this glitch. You can perform this glitch by entering the checkpoint menu and then pressing the action of choice within a few frames of entering the menu. To get a feel for the timing, practice without a power, but with a weapon in hand. If you successfully complete the glitch, you will drop you gun at the same time the checkpoint menu appears. Spin Dash High Jumps (SDHJ) In a good number of Sonic series games, there is a technique called the Spin Dash Jump where the player starts a spin dash, then jumps shortly after releasing the charged spin dash allowing for long jumps over normally impossible to reach areas. The Spin Dash High Jump works the same, but instead of moving forwards across a stage, you hit a sloped object / level geometry which redirects you up for a very high jump. Death Loops This trick / glitch, exploits a small window between an enemy death and its despawn. During this small window, you can use a healing burst to revive the enemy. You only get the points for healing the enemy once, but repeating the trick, you can get multiple points for defeating the enemy. This allows you to grind one enemy for a full meter's worth of points. This is normally possible with GUN Solders without needing to do anything special, but for enemies like the Black Warrior (which despawn shortly after death), you cannot get additional points without this trick. Wall Run Warps There are some areas in the game where Shadow can use his Triangle Jump / Wall Run technique to make it through a section with no floor. A very useful technique, but there some areas in the game were the position calculations made after colliding with an object / level geometry go crazy. Most of the time, this sends you into the void or instantly kills you, but there are some sweet spots that allow you to warp into another part of the stage. By some miracle, some of these warps can lead you to the level's goal ring. It's so powerful, yet so difficult to pull of, it created a new split in the speedrun categories so runners don't have to worry about needing to use this trick to actually be competitive. Chaos Control Extension When using Chaos Control, it will go for a set amount of time, regardless of how much of you hero meter you have left. This trick is specifically for the case where you have already been using Chaos Control for a bit, but canceled just before running out of the meter, thus being able to reactivate before the meter is completely drained. If you do so at the right time in the right spot, you can go further into a level than just the single Chaos Control could. Leaving Secret Doors Open This is a trick that is mainly used in Individual Level (IL) attempts, where every second counts. Normally when starting a stage from the beginning, you need to wait at Secret Doors for them to complete their opening animation before you can pass. If you die mid stage, the doors you have already opened will skip their animations and open immediately. If you open the Secret Doors a head of time and die without hitting any checkpoints, you can complete a full stage playthrough, where the doors you need are already opened. This is legal in the current rules for IL attempts, but the runner must include the opening of the doors in the video prior to the attempt that uses the opened doors. This is so the mechanic is clearly shown for anyone that happens to be watching without prior knowledge of the trick. Pause Buffering When playing on some consoles, the game can have a bit of time after using Chaos Control or moving very fast between sections where the enemies are not ready in memory and will need more time before appearing in the world. When this occurs, the player can pause the game and unpause shortly after to help give the game more time to load in the missing content. This is helpful for runs that focus on the In Game Timer, or runs where doing this helps with the real time needed to continue. Chaos Control Route/Spline Control in Expert Mode The mission/partner currently selected affects which spline Shadow takes when using Chaos Control. In Expert Mode, it is still possible to set this flag in the pause menu. Pause the game Press \"down\", highlighting \"restart\" Press \"right\", setting the 'hero' flag You'll know it worked because the \"restart\" will move back up to \"resume\" with no noise Press \"A\" (or equivalent for non-GameCube, not the Start or pause/unpause button!) Doing the same but for \"left\" would set the 'dark' flag Further details can be found here Hurt Animation Cancel If holding a weapon when damaged and Shadow is on the ground, pressing Y cancels the animation into the weapon drop animation. Maximum Spindash Time The maximum spindash distance can be achieved with exactly 1.00 seconds, with a sharp decay rate even at 0.75 seconds. 2.00 seconds = 86.5 game units 1.00 seconds = 86.5 game units 0.98 seconds = 85 game units 0.75 seconds = 64 game units 0.5 seconds = 39 game units Artificial Chaos Point Duplication The amount of points you duplicate are based on how many individual separate chibis are destroyed in the same frame when the health of the artifical chaos reaches 0. It is possible to duplicate points by jumping or using the satellite laser, though using the omochao gun can provide huge multipliers not possible by jumping / satellite laser.","title":"Speedrun Tricks Explained"},{"location":"GettingStarted/SpeedrunTricks/#speedrun-tricks-explained","text":"","title":"Speedrun Tricks Explained"},{"location":"GettingStarted/SpeedrunTricks/#faster-rank-screen-stage-result-screen","text":"After completing a stage, if you press the Start button shortly after the letter rank is on screen you will begin the fadescreen earlier.

Your movement options are limited due to being in a skydiving like state where you can only move horizontally while falling. <Picture of Shadow next to Expert Helicopter> In Expert Mode, there is a Helicopter you can bump into which will cause damage. However, after you do so, you exit the skydiving state and are allowed to do more actions. One of these actions is the ability to use the Light Dash on the vertical ring paths which allows you to reach the bottom of the section faster. Note that the Light Dash works both ways, so you will need to be careful in your positioning to ensure a downward Light Dash. <Picture of Shadow next to Dash Ramp> Once you reach the bottom, simply use the dash ramp to progress to the next area. If you used the Light Dash to get here faster, be mindful that the building just after the dash ramp needs a bit more time to finish animating out of the way. Using the dash ramp too early will result in a death after running into the building. Intro to First Emerald <Show Shadow on Checkpoint 1> Black Arm Units in this Section Unit # Available Black Wing 4 Black Warrior 2 GUN Units in this Section Unit # Available GUN Soldier 5 Weapons Available in this Section Weapon # Available Notes Pistol 5 Get from a GUN Soldier Here you will find the first checkpoint and just beyond it there is a single GUN Soldier and a Black Wing. A laser will come down and murder the GUN Soldier if you stay in the area long enough. You can also quickly kill the Black Wing by jumping near the end of the road. <Picture of Shadow next to Spin Dash Spot> Sonic is just past the road blocks to greet you and to the right is a section of buildings that will soon be destroyed by another laser. To get fast hero points, you can charge a Spin Dash just in front of the buildings and launch just after laser finishes firing. Doing so will net you 6000 Hero Meter Points. It is recommended to do this for Normal or Dark Mission Speedruns, but not for Hero as it is slightly slower than going forward and is not necessary for gathering Hero Points for Chaos Control considering the extra points you will get by defeating Black Arms Units normally skipped in the other missions. <Picture of Shadow next to First Black Warrior> After progressing a bit further down the road, you will come across a GUN Soldier and 3 Black Arms units. This is a common place to pickup your first gun, a pistol, by attacking the GUN Soldier to make him drop it. You can use this to quickly kill the 3 Black Arms Units. Note: If you stay behind the roadblocks the Black Arms cannot reach you and will not be able to attack you. <Picture of Shadow next to First Black Warrior, but Expert> In Expert Mode, there will be an extra GUN Soldier with a shield and a SMG. The SMG is nice to grab here as the one we would grab later on in Story Mode is not there. Just after the downward turn, there is a single Black Wing which can be quickly killed with a well timed shot. <Picture of Shadow approaching Emerald Cage> There are a few ways to handle this next section. If going for a Hero or Normal Mission, you will want to kill the Black Warrior which will then unlock the Emerald Cage. After the Emerald is acquired, the cage for the spring pad will open allowing you into the next section. If going for the Dark Mission, you will need to slow down a bit to ensure the 3 GUN Soldiers are defeated. You will also need to defeat the Black Warrior to get up to the next section, but if you are fast enough and the GUN Soldier furthest back is in a good position, you can perform a Spin Dash High Jump off the fallen soldier to skip needing to open the spring pad cage. Doom's Eye to Checkpoint 2 <Show Shadow in front of Doom's Eye> Black Arm Units in this Section Unit # Available Black Wing 11 Black Warrior 6 GUN Units in this Section Unit # Available GUN Soldier 5 Weapons Available in this Section Weapon # Available Notes Pistol 4 In Box or Get from a GUN Soldier SMG 4 In Box or Get from a GUN Soldier Light Shot 2 Get from Black Warrior After meeting Doom's Eye for the Dark Mission objective, you will see 2 GUN Soldiers and 2 Black Wings. These Black Wings are easy points for the Normal Mission and necessary for the Hero Mission. The 2 GUN Soldiers can be avoided unless you are completing the Dark Mission. <Show Shadow in front of Dark Orb> To the far left side, there are some buildings that will be struct by a laser. If you go destroy the building next to it manually, it will reveal a Dark Aura Orb which will max out your Dark Meter. <Show Shadow approaching barrier> To the right of the SMG box, before the barrier, there are 2 more Black Wings. These can be avoided if not completing the Hero Mission, but can provide extra Hero points if you missed out on the Flames in the beginning of the level. More often than not, you will want to break the weapon box to grab the SMG for more ammo and automatic firing. You can either wait for the laser to destroy the barrier to continue on, or use a gun to destroy it and continue through before the laser lands. <Show Shadow just after the barrier> After the barrier, there are a handful of Black Arms units, most of which are necessary to kill to gain enough Hero points for Chaos Control. At the top of the slope, there is another GUN Soldier you can defeat to refill on SMG ammo. <Show Shadow just after the SMG refill> At this point, for the Normal Mission, you can look at your score to get a good idea on how many Black Arms unit you need to kill to get the right about of Chaos Control at the right time. Details on which enemies give which points can be found on this page: Health, Points, and Other Values for Routing <Show Shadow just after turn> A few more Black Arms units here. You will need to kill some or all of them depending on the Mission and when you want Chaos Control. Key 1 The first key in the level is just before the Dash Ramp to the second checkpoint. Turn the camera to look at the right side and it will be in plain view. Checkpoint 2 to Checkpoint 3 <Show Shadow on Checkpoint 2> Black Arm Units in this Section Unit # Available Black Wing x Black Warrior x GUN Units in this Section Unit # Available GUN Soldier x GUN Beetle x Weapons Available in this Section Weapon # Available Notes Pistol x In Box or Get from a GUN Soldier SMG x In Box or Get from a GUN Soldier Light Shot x Get from Black Warrior This checkpoint is the one you will be using Chaos Control Glitch (CCG) on to complete the Normal Mission if allowed. You can break the boxes nearby to fill the Hero Meter and activate Hero Shadow if you are just shy of having enough points. Key 2 Above the Triangle Jump section, the 2nd key is waiting to be picked up. Key 3 Right before the downward slope to the 3rd checkpoint, you can perform a Homing Attack on the GUN Beetles which will put you on a platform. From there, you can jump onto the one in front holding the 3rd key. Key 4 To the left of the 3rd checkpoint there is a caged room with a few dumpsters. You can Slide or Spin Dash under the gate to enter the room. The middle dumpster is hiding the 4th key, simply destroy the dumpster to collect it. Shadow Boxes Box 1 Location Default Weapon Flash Shot Key 5 The final key is located in the beginning of the second city dive section in the bottom right of the screen. The Helicopter is patrolling the area and if you enter too soon, it will block access to the key. Waiting a few seconds before using the Dash Ramp or having Invincibility powers will make getting this key possible. Expert Mode Differences Other Missing SMG box between Doom's Eye and the barrier. Before Second Checkpoint there is no longer a ramp. A Triangle Jump or Spin Dash Jump is required to get to the ring path that get you to the second checkpoint. Platforming for the second checkpoint area is different. Extra Black Warrior at the bus after checkpoint 3. No ring trail downhill to the first Shadow Box. Section after 4th checkpoint is different. There is a bus with a second Shadow Box behind it, neither of which are normally there.

You will also need to defeat the Black Warrior to get up to the next section, but if you are fast enough and the GUN Soldier furthest back is in a good position, you can perform a Spin Dash High Jump off the fallen soldier to skip needing to open the spring pad cage.","title":"Weapons Available in this Section"},{"location":"Levels/Westopolis/#dooms-eye-to-checkpoint-2","text":"<Show Shadow in front of Doom's Eye>","title":"Doom's Eye to Checkpoint 2"},{"location":"Levels/Westopolis/#black-arm-units-in-this-section_1","text":"Unit # Available Black Wing 11 Black Warrior 6","title":"Black Arm Units in this Section"},{"location":"Levels/Westopolis/#gun-units-in-this-section_1","text":"Unit # Available GUN Soldier 5","title":"GUN Units in this Section"},{"location":"Levels/Westopolis/#weapons-available-in-this-section_1","text":"Weapon # Available Notes Pistol 4 In Box or Get from a GUN Soldier SMG 4 In Box or Get from a GUN Soldier Light Shot 2 Get from Black Warrior After meeting Doom's Eye for the Dark Mission objective, you will see 2 GUN Soldiers and 2 Black Wings. These Black Wings are easy points for the Normal Mission and necessary for the Hero Mission. The 2 GUN Soldiers can be avoided unless you are completing the Dark Mission. <Show Shadow in front of Dark Orb> To the far left side, there are some buildings that will be struct by a laser. If you go destroy the building next to it manually, it will reveal a Dark Aura Orb which will max out your Dark Meter. <Show Shadow approaching barrier> To the right of the SMG box, before the barrier, there are 2 more Black Wings. These can be avoided if not completing the Hero Mission, but can provide extra Hero points if you missed out on the Flames in the beginning of the level. More often than not, you will want to break the weapon box to grab the SMG for more ammo and automatic firing. You can either wait for the laser to destroy the barrier to continue on, or use a gun to destroy it and continue through before the laser lands. <Show Shadow just after the barrier> After the barrier, there are a handful of Black Arms units, most of which are necessary to kill to gain enough Hero points for Chaos Control. At the top of the slope, there is another GUN Soldier you can defeat to refill on SMG ammo. <Show Shadow just after the SMG refill> At this point, for the Normal Mission, you can look at your score to get a good idea on how many Black Arms unit you need to kill to get the right about of Chaos Control at the right time. Details on which enemies give which points can be found on this page: Health, Points, and Other Values for Routing <Show Shadow just after turn> A few more Black Arms units here. You will need to kill some or all of them depending on the Mission and when you want Chaos Control.","title":"Weapons Available in this Section"},{"location":"Levels/Westopolis/#key-1","text":"The first key in the level is just before the Dash Ramp to the second checkpoint.

But we also see that they were not built at the same time. While not always the case with games, there are a handful of differences between games these builds depending on when they were built, even if they were released at the same time. For example, the versions build on Oct 16th and later have the powerful Chaos Control Glitch patched. Making the US GameCube and PS2 versions the only ones that can perform that glitch. The Oct 16th and later versions also have a few minor level object (layout) differences, extra objects are added as documented below.

Final Haunt contains duplicates of objects found in the cmn layout, in the hrd (expert mode) layout. There are 4 extra Black Oaks stacked into their original object and 3 extra platforms stacked into original objects. Likely these duplicate objects were a copy/paste mistake while the ChaosControlStop Triggers were added. The Doom lowers the render distance of the GUN Robot with LinkID 170, located right after the 6th checkpoint in the proceeding elevator room. This is a significant change as pre-Oct 16 builds of the game have to warp away with the checkpoint and back again to get this robot to spawn for the mission The Doom Dark. Lost Impact adds extra SolidCollisions to the ceiling of some rooms, preventing out of bounds ceiling jumps via spindash jump- none of which are currently used in runs anyway. Additionally, there is an extra GUN Beetle and GUN Soldier at the 8th checkpoint. Other stage changes consistent primarily of adding in ChaosControlStop Triggers that act as quick bugfixes. These prevent players from going the wrong way in Expert Mode while using Chaos Control. Ex: Cryptic Castle Dark route instead of Normal route while in Expert Mode. Unknown changes mean the object counts are identical across versions, but there is a checksum difference. Likely an object was tweaked: position, rotation, object parameters (which weapon an enemy holds, how they behave, etc). Alternatively, it is possible an object was swapped out entirely for another object (ex Metal box for Wood box).
